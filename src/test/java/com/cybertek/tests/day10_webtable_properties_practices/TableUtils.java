    //RACTICE #4: Method: verifyOrder
    //• Create a method named verifyOrder in TableUtils class.
    //• Method takes WebDriver object and String(name).
    //• Method should verify if given name exists in orders.
    //• This method should simply accepts a name(String), and assert whether
    //given name is in the list or not.
    //• Create a new TestNG test to test if the method is working as expected.
